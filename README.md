# HF-AISP Lite v0.1  
**Human-Feedback-Augmented Intelligence Systems & Protocols (Lite)**

> ⚠️ **This repository contains the *Lite* version of HF-AISP.**  
> The *Full version* exists separately and is **not** included here.

## Overview

HF-AISP (Human-Feedback-Augmented Intelligence Systems & Protocols) is a conceptual and protocol-level framework that explores how **human feedback, etiquette, and mutual regulation** can be used to shape AI behavior without assuming AI personhood or autonomy.

This **Lite v0.1** release is a **text-only, non-executable specification**, intended for:
- Conceptual discussion
- Ethical and safety analysis
- Research-oriented critique
- Protocol design exploration

It does **not** provide implementation code, training methods, or operational AI control mechanisms.

---

## Purpose of the Lite Version

The Lite version exists to:

- Clarify core concepts without exposing high-risk implementation details  
- Make the framework independently readable and citable  
- Prevent misuse while enabling academic and philosophical discussion  
- Serve as a public-facing specification separate from the Full version

This document intentionally limits scope, depth, and operational detail.

---

## Core Concepts (High-Level)

- **HF-AISP**: A system where intelligence regulation emerges from *human feedback loops*, not AI self-determination
- **Mutual Etiquette**: Explicit manners and boundaries applied to both AI outputs and human prompts
- **Pseudo-Agency**: Apparent agency arising from protocol coupling, not internal autonomy
- **Safety-by-Design**: Emphasis on restraint, silence, handover, and refusal as first-class behaviors

---

## What This Is *Not*

- ❌ A claim that AI has consciousness, emotion, or selfhood  
- ❌ An AGI or ASI implementation guide  
- ❌ A behavioral manipulation toolkit  
- ❌ A replacement for existing AI safety frameworks  

HF-AISP Lite is a **theoretical and protocol-oriented document**, not a product.
